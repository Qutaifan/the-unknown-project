# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) System

## Introduction

This project implements a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system using PyTorch and PettingZoo. Agents are assigned specific roles (e.g., leader, follower) to perform coordinated tasks within the environment.

## Features

- **Role-Based Agents:** Specialized behaviors based on assigned roles.
- **Graph Neural Networks:** Utilizes GNNs for policy representation.
- **Configurable Hyperparameters:** Managed via YAML configuration files.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Integrated logging and TensorBoard for monitoring.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust error management for uninterrupted training.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensures reliability and correctness of components.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-rl-system.git
cd multi-agent-rl-system
